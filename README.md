# Overview

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a widely used technique for analyzing people’s opinions and sentiments at the aspect level, particularly in customer reviews (Zhang et al., 2023). However, current ABSA research predominantly adopts a coarse-grained, categorical sentiment representation (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral). This approach stands in contrast to long-established theories in psychology and affective science (Russell, 1980; 2003), where sentiment is represented along fine-grained, real-valued dimensions of **valence** (ranging from negative to positive) and **arousal** (from sluggish to excited), as illustrated in Fig. 1.

This valence-arousal (VA) representation has inspired the rise of dimensional sentiment analysis as an emerging research paradigm (Mohammad, 2018; Lee et al., 2022, 2024; Muhammad et al., 2025), enabling more nuanced distinctions in emotional expression and supporting a broader range of applications.

</p>

To bridge this gap, we propose **Dimensional ABSA (DimABSA)**, a shared task that integrates dimensional sentiment analysis into the traditional ABSA framework. Furthermore, there is a conceptual similarity between stance detection and ABSA when the stance target is treated as an aspect. Building on this, we introduce **Dimensional Stance Analysis (DimStance)**, a Stance-as-DimABSA task that reformulates stance detection under the ABSA schema in the VA space. This new formulation extends ABSA beyond consumer reviews to public-issue discourse (e.g., social, political, energy, climate) and also generalizes stance analysis from categorical labels to continuous VA scores. 

# Task Description

This shared task is organized into two complementary tracks: **DimABSA** and **DimStance**. 

## Track A: DimABSA  

Current ABSA research typically focuses on identifying four key sentiment elements: **aspect terms**, **aspect categories**, **opinion terms**, and **sentiment polarity**. DimABSA extends traditional ABSA by replacing categorical sentiment polarity with continuous **VA scores**. For example, given the sentence “*The salads are fantastic.*”, the extracted elements under the two settings would be:

- **ABSA**: *`salads`*, `FOOD#QUALITY`, *`fantastic`*, `Positive`  
- **DimABSA**: *`salads`*, `FOOD#QUALITY`, *`fantastic`*, `7.88#7.75`  

The details of each element involved in this task are described below.

- **Aspect Term**: A word or phrase indicating an opinion target, such as *appetizer*, *waiter*, *battery*, or *screen*.
- **Aspect Category**: An abstract or predefined category to which an aspect term belongs. It follows the format *Entity#Attribute*, where the *Entity* (e.g., FOOD, SERVICE) and *Attribute* (e.g., PRICES, QUALITY) are selected from predefined lists (Pontiki et al., 2015; 2016). For all valid combinations, see the [full list of aspect categories](#full-list-of-aspect-categories).
- **Opinion Term**: A sentiment-bearing word or phrase associated with a specific aspect term, such as *great*, *terrible*, or *satisfactory*.
- **Valence-Arousal (VA)**: A pair of real-valued scores, each ranging from **1.00 to 9.00**, rounded to two decimal places.  
    - **Valence**: Measures the degree of positivity or negativity.  
    - **Arousal**: Measures the intensity of emotion.  
    A score of **1.00** indicates extremely negative valence or very low arousal, **9.00** indicates extremely positive valence or very high arousal, and **5.00** represents a neutral valence or medium arousal.

Based on the above elements, we define three subtasks, each adapted from a traditional ABSA task to the dimensional sentiment paradigm. Participants may choose to participate in one or more of the following subtasks, depending on their research interest or application focus.

### Subtask 1: Dimensional Aspect Sentiment Regression (DimASR)

Given a text and one or more aspects, predict a real-valued **valence-arousal (VA)** score for each aspect. This extends Aspect Sentiment Classification (ASC) (Pontiki et al., 2014; 2015; 2016).  

The input is in JSON Lines format and includes the following fields.
- `ID` → Unique identifier for the instance
- `Text` → A sentence or paragraph expressing subjective opinions
- `Aspect` → A list of one or more target aspects mentioned in the text

The output should be in JSON Lines format and include the following fields. All textual outputs are **case-sensitive**.
- `ID` → A unique identifier that exactly matches the input ID.  
- `Aspect_VA` → A list of objects, where each object contains:  
  - `Aspect` → The aspect name(s) exactly as they appear in the input (case-sensitive, same order).  
  - `VA` → The valence-arousal score is represented in the `V#A` format, with each value ranging from 1.00 to 9.00 and **rounded to two decimal places**.  

Below are examples from different domains that are included in this subtask.

### Subtask 3: Dimensional Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (DimASQP)
Given a text, extract all **(A, C, O, VA)** quadruplets, where A denotes an aspect term, C an aspect category, O an opinion term, and VA a valence-arousal score. This extends Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) (Cai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021).

- `Text` – A sentence or paragraph expressing subjective opinions.

The output should be in JSON Lines format and include the following fields. All textual outputs are **case-sensitive**.
- `ID` – A unique identifier that exactly matches the input ID.
- `Quadruplet` – A list of extracted quadruplets, where each quadruplet contains:
    - `Aspect` – The aspect term, which should retain the same case as in the input text.
    - `Category` – The aspect category, formatted as `ENTITY#ATTRIBUTE` and written in **UPPERCASE**. For all valid combinations, see the [full list of aspect categories](#full-list-of-aspect-categories).
    - `Opinion` – The opinion term, which should retain the same case as in the input text.
    - `VA` – The valence-arousal score is represented in the `V#A` format, with each value ranging from 1.00 to 9.00 and **rounded to two decimal places**.

## Track B: DimStance  

<!--
This track reformulates **stance detection** under the ABSA schema in the VA space. Traditional stance detection identifies whether a speaker is *in favor of*, *neutral toward*, or *against* a target entity [Mohammad et al., 2017]. We introduce **DimStance**, which adapts this task as follows:
-->

Given an utterance or post and a target entity, stance detection involves determining whether the speaker is in favor or against the target (Mohammad et. al., 2017). This track reformulates stance detection as a **Stance-as-DimABSA** task with the following transformations: 

1. The stance target is treated as an aspect.  
2. Discrete stance labels are replaced with continuous VA scores.
<!--  
4. Opinion terms are incorporated to align with the ABSA structure.  
-->

Based on this formulation, we define two subtasks equivalent to those in Track A, with the stance target regarded as the aspect.
 
### Subtask 1: Dimensional Aspect Sentiment Regression (DimASR)  

Given a text and one or more aspects (targets), predict a real-valued **valence-arousal (VA)** score for each aspect, reflecting the stance expressed by the speaker toward it.  

The input is in JSON Lines format and includes the following fields.
- `ID` → Unique identifier for the instance
- `Text` → A sentence or paragraph expressing subjective opinions
- `Aspect` → A list of one or more target aspects mentioned in the text

The output should be in JSON Lines format and include the following fields. All textual outputs are **case-sensitive**.
- `ID` → A unique identifier that exactly matches the input ID.  
- `Aspect_VA` → A list of objects, where each object contains:  
  - `Aspect` → The aspect name(s) exactly as they appear in the input (case-sensitive, same order).  
  - `VA` → The valence-arousal score is represented in the `V#A` format, with each value ranging from 1.00 to 9.00 and **rounded to two decimal places**.

DimASR is a sentiment regression task evaluated using ***Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)*** between the predicted and gold VA values:

$$
RMSE_{VA} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N 
   \frac{(V_p^{(i)} - V_g^{(i)})^2 + (A_p^{(i)} - A_g^{(i)})^2}{N} }
$$

where $N$ is the total number of instances; ${V_p^{(i)}}$ and ${A_p^{(i)}}$ denote the predicted valence and arousal values for instance $i$; and ${V_g^{(i)}}$ and ${A_g^{(i)}}$ denote the corresponding gold values.

Notes: VA outputs must be within [1, 9], rounded to two decimals. 

**Subtask 2 & 3: DimASTE & DimASQP (continuous F1)** 

DimASTE and DimASQP are sentiment analysis tasks involving extraction, classification, and regression. Their outputs contain both categorical elements (e.g., A, C, O) and continuous elements (VA), which have traditionally been evaluated using separate metrics. In conventional ABSA tasks, categorical elements are assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score, where a predicted tuple is counted as a *true positive (TP)* only if all its categorical elements exactly match the gold annotation. This binary criterion, however, does not account for continuous-valued components, which are typically evaluated using correlation-based or difference-based metrics. To unify the evaluation of categorical and continuous components, we propose the ***continuous true positive (cTP)***, which extends the categorical TP by incorporating a penalty based on the VA prediction error. Let *P* be the set of predicted triplets (A, O, VA) or quadruplets (A, C, O, VA). For a prediction $t \in P$, its *cTP* is defined as

$$
cTP^{(t)} =
\begin{cases}
1 - \text{dist}(VA_p^{(t)}, VA_g^{(t)}), & t \in P_{cat} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $P_{cat} \subseteq P$ denotes the set of predictions in which all categorical elements, (A, O) for a triplet or (A, C, O) for a quadruplet, exactly match the gold annotation for the same sentence. Each categorically correct prediction $t \in P_{cat}$ is assigned an initial TP score of 1, which is then reduced based on its VA error distance. Predictions with no categorical match are assigned a score of 0. The distance function is defined as 

$$
dist(VA_p, VA_g) = \frac{\sqrt{\left( V_p - V_g \right)^2 + \left( A_p - A_g \right)^2}}{D_{max}},
$$

where $dist(\cdot)$ denotes the normalized Euclidean distance between the predicted $VA_p = (V_p, A_p)$ and gold $VA_g = (V_g, A_g)$ in the VA space, and $D_{max}=\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2}=\sqrt{128}$  is the maximum possible Euclidean distance in the VA space on the [1, 9] scale, ensuring that $dist$ ⊆ [0, 1].

Building on per-prediction $cTP^{(t)}$, ***continuous Recall (cRecall)*** is defined as the total *cTP* divided by the number of gold triplets/quadruplets:

$$
cRecall = \frac{{T{P_{cat}} - \sum\nolimits_{t \in {P_{cat}}} {{\rm{dist(}}VA_p^{(t)}{\rm{, }}VA_g^{(t)}{\rm{)}}} }}{{T{P_{cat}} + F{N_{cat}}}},
$$

where the numerator represents the total *cTP*, computed as the number of categorically correct predictions $TP_{cat} = \lvert P_{cat} \rvert$  minus the sum of their VA error distances, and $FN_{cat}$ denotes the number of gold triplets/quadruplets with no categorical match.

Similarly, the ***continuous Precision (cPrecision)*** is defined as the total *cTP* divided by the number of predictions.

$$
cPrecision = \frac{{T{P_{cat}} - \sum\nolimits_{t \in {P_{cat}}} {{\rm{dist(}}VA_p^{(t)}{\rm{, }}VA_g^{(t)}{\rm{)}}} }}{{T{P_{cat}} + F{P_{cat}}}},
$$

where $FP_{cat}$ denotes the number of predictions with no categorical match. Figure 2 illustrates an example of calculating *cTP*, *cRecall*, and *cPrecision*.

Finally, the ***continuous F1 (cF1)*** is the harmonic mean of *cRecall* and *cPrecision*.

$$
cF{\rm{1}} = \frac{{2 \times cRecall \times cPrecision}}{{cRecall + cPrecision}}
$$

</p>

Notes: 
1. When the VA prediction is perfect (*dist*=0), *cRecall*/*cPrecision* reduces to the standard *recall*/*precision*.
2. VA outputs must be within [1, 9], rounded to two decimals. Any prediction with either V or A outside this range is considered invalid.
3. Participants should remove duplicate predictions before submission. If multiple predictions in the same sentence share the same categorical tuple (A,O) for triplets or (A,C,O) for quadruplets, all of them are considered invalid.
